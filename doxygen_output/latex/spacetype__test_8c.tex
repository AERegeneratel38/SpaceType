char \textbf{ text2} [450] = \{\char`\"{}Today, historians relate that, as a general rule, buying and selling securities was very much unorganized before the year 1792. Every person who owned a security faced the problem of finding interested buyers who might consider the purchase of a debt-\/free investment. This meant most people were somewhat slow in investing in stocks and bonds because these securities could not readily be converted into money.\char`\"{}\}

char \textbf{ text3} [456] = \{\char`\"{}A data entry clerk is a member of staff employed to enter or update data into a computer system. Data is often entered into a computer from paper documents using a keyboard. The keyboards used can often have special keys -\/ Alt, Ctrl, Fn, Shift -\/ multiple colors to help in the task \& speed up the work. Proper ergonomics at the workstation is a common topic considered. The Data Entry Clerk may also use a mouse, and a manually-\/fed scanner may be involved.\char`\"{}\}

Key federal regulations were formulated by the FDA, FTC, and the CPSC. Each of these federal agencies serves a specific mission. One example\+: Laws sponsored by the Office of the Fair Debt Collection Practices prevent an agency from purposefully harassing clients in serious debt. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act makes certain that protection from misleading packaging of goods is guaranteed to each buyer.\char`\"{}\}

{\footnotesize\ttfamily void test\+\_\+process (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{char}]{test\+\_\+text[$\,$] }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



Handles the typing test process. 

This function divides the large text into smaller parts, and displays it on the screen to make it easier for the user. Gets the key pressed by the user, checks with the letter from the text, and highlights if its correct. The second part of the text only displayed once the displayed part is enterred correctly. Statistics like typing speed, accuracy are shown at the end.
